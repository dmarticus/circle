# unknot

> In the mathematical theory of knots, the unknot, or trivial knot, is the least knotted of all knots. Intuitively, the unknot is a closed loop of rope without a knot tied into it, unknotted. To a knot theorist, an unknot is any embedded topological circle in the 3-sphere that is ambient isotopic (that is, deformable) to a geometrically round circle, the standard unknot.

I'm not knot theorist, but it seemed like as good a name as any for this library, which is an API Client for [Circle](https://developers.circle.com/)
